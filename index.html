    <h2>Who I Am</h2>
    <div id="font">
    <p > I am a young IT enthuthiast who decided to dive into the exciting world of programming.
    I acquainted myself with coding skills from<a href="https://moringaschool.com/"> Moringa School</a>- A brilliant institution I should say.My intrinsic drive to do programming was inspired by wanting to discontinue a trend of constant consumerism; by learning how to give back to the community not only through creating brilliant Apps, but also teaching the skill
    to young aspiring computer programmers.<br>I am also a subtle self-taught artist (<a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1hjtGKC5JUB8N9zLXGLn_JTIy1FCdR4cn"><strong>My art</strong></a>) and in many
    ways <strong>art</strong> helped me in my amazing coding journey.<strong>It</strong> has helped me nature moral-excellencies like <em>patience, gentleness, keenness and creativity</em>.</p>
